            <img id="aboutPic" src="assets/images/portfolioImg.jpg" alt="Renee Hickman's Bio Picture">
            <p>Since I was young, I have always been inspired by the world around me. For the past 9 years, video
                editing and digital design has been the main way I express my love for the things I'm passionate about.
                Looking at my past work, I see that I'm ultimately driven by my unique perspective on relating to the
                world around me. No matter the medium, I enjoy inspiring the creativity in others.</p>
            </br>
            <p>When I'm not on the ice playing hockey, it is my passion to design, edit, code and create. I am
                currently pursuring my niche for coding through SMU's coding bootcamp. I have a focus on front end
                development and am excited to see what is next on my journey.</p>
